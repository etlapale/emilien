title: About
---

I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the laboratory of
[Barbara Dosher]("http://www.socsci.uci.edu/maplab/"), in which I study
perceptual learning in visual motion stimuli. This study combines
numerical simulations and psychophysical experiments.

Before that I worked in the
[neuromathcomp](http://www-sop.inria.fr/neuromathcomp) team, in which
I designed models of visual motion processing in the primate brain.
There I completed a PhD thesis under the supervision of
[Pierre Kornprobst](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Pierre.Kornprobst) (INRIA)
and
[Guillaume Masson](http://www.int.univ-amu.fr/MASSON-Guillaume) (INT).

Between 2007 and 2010 I taught C++ classes to fifth year electronic students
(CSS) at
[Polytech Nice Sophia](http://www.polytechnice.fr/fr/electronique/page83.html). I also helped with system programming tutorials at
[IUT Nice](http://www.iut.unice.fr/), as well as C programming at
University of Nice Sophia Antipolis.
