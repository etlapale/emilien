db2ooxml
========
``db2ooxml`` converts DocBook_ articles to Office OpenXML documents,
that is Word 2007 docx files. The main goal is to get a clean Word
document, with simple styling, while supporting numerous DocBook
features such as: mathematical equations, figures, tables, citations
or revisions.

The code consists of XSLT stylesheets converting from DocBook_ to
WordML, and a Python wrapper to process them and generate the final
document with embedded media.
